## Requirements of the Infra
As specified previously, these were the requirements of the web application/infrastructure:
1) The infrastructure must be provisioned on AWS automatically without manual intervention
2) The web application service should still be up when an AWS availability zone fails
3) The web traffic should be load balanced across multiple availability zones
4) Any changes to the infrastructure must be performed without manual intervention
5) The design should be based on best practices with security in mind
